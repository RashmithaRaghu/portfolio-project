🔧 Project Update – Form Validation Feature

I worked on adding client-side form validation to improve the accuracy and quality of user inputs in the Portfolio Builder project. The validation ensures that all required fields are correctly filled before generating the final portfolio.

✅ What Was Implemented

Added a validation function (simpleValidate()) to check all mandatory fields.

Highlighted empty or incorrect fields using a red border (input-error CSS class).

Ensured smooth UX with:

Automatic focus on invalid fields

Smooth scrolling to the error section

Added phone number validation (must be exactly 10 digits).

Added email format validation using regular expressions.

Improved input sanitization by trimming spaces and preventing invalid characters.

📌 Why This Matters

These validations:

Prevent incomplete or incorrect portfolio generation

Make the form more user-friendly

Reduce errors and ensure clean data

Improve the professional quality of the final portfolio output
